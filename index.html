        <h1 class="work print text instructions1-desc">1. Take a thick marker and make a point on the top right corner of the paper, do not lift
            the marker. Let the ink bleed for at least 1-15 seconds.<br>
            2. Lift the pen and make another dot below it. Let the ink bleed.<br>
            3. Repeat that several times until all the different sized dots roughly form a vertical line along
            the whole paper. Doesn’t matter if some dots are further or closer away to each other.<br>
            4. Repeat that 5 more times. You should now have 6 vertical lines that are each formed by the dots.
            Make sure the lines are separated. You can also try making some lines closer or further away from
            each other.<br>
            5. Take a pen and very quickly draw a vertical line through the first set of dots.
            Do that for the rest.<br>
            6. Now take the pen and try to connect the first dot from all six lines. At the end you should have
            a horizontal line that goes across the page.<br>
            7. Do that multiple multiple times so that at the end you have a web/grid.</h1>
