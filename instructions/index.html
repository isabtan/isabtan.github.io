    <h1>Isabelle's Instruction Set</h1>
    <li>Take a thick marker and make a point on the top right corner of the paper, do not lift the marker. Let the ink bleed for at least 5-15 seconds.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Lift the pen and make another dot below it. Let the ink bleed. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Repeat that several times until all the different sized dots roughly form a vertical line along the whole paper. Doesn’t matter if some dots are further or closer away to each other.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Repeat that 5 more times. You should now have 6 vertical lines that are each formed by the dots. Make sure the lines are separated. You can also try making some lines closer or further away from each other.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Take a pen and very quickly draw a vertical line through the first set of dots. Do that for the rest.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Now take the pen and try to connect the first dot from all six lines. At the end you should have a horizontal line that goes across the page.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Do that multiple multiple times so that at the end you have a web/grid. 
    </li>
